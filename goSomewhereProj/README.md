Go Somewhere

Paragraph about:
'Go Somewhere' is an event-based application that allows users to search for popular 
events through a map-based interface in a given location (Halifax or Toronto in this case). 
The application screens Tweets from a backend Twitter API filter allowing users to gauge
 the number of individuals at a particular event, what the event is and further details
about the business (i.e. location, contact information and social media links). 
Furthermore, users can share their experience about the environment and access features
 such as checking-in and sharing photos about the event when present at the location.    

Requirements:
Mobile phone/application running Android 4.1 and up.

Navigation:
1. Login or sign up.
2. Pick your city (Toronto or Halifax).
3. Pick an event from the populated list of event bubbles on the map or go to list-view a select from a list of events nearby. 
4. Open an event and navigate to that event.
